# Runtime Proxy

> [!WARNING]
> The runtime proxy is in active development. Behavior, flags, and API surface may change in any release while it remains pre-1.0. Treat it as preview-quality and pin to a specific Clawvisor version in production.

The runtime proxy is a TLS-terminating egress proxy that runs inside the Clawvisor daemon. When enabled, an agent's outbound HTTPS traffic is routed through it so Clawvisor can observe model API calls, intercept tool-use, hold inline approvals, capture or substitute credentials, and attribute every request to a runtime session.

It is complementary to the gateway: gateway requests describe what the agent intends to do; the runtime proxy sees what it actually sends on the wire.

## Enable the proxy

The proxy is gated behind `runtime_proxy.enabled` and ships off by default.

In `config.yaml`:

```yaml
runtime_proxy:
  enabled: true
  listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:25290
  data_dir: ~/.clawvisor/runtime-proxy
  session_ttl_seconds: 3600
  listener_hostnames:
    - localhost
    - 127.0.0.1
```

Or via environment variables:

```bash
export CLAWVISOR_RUNTIME_PROXY_ENABLED=true
export CLAWVISOR_RUNTIME_PROXY_LISTEN_ADDR=127.0.0.1:25290
```

Restart the daemon to pick up the change:

```bash
clawvisor-server restart
```

On first start, the proxy generates a CA at `~/.clawvisor/runtime-proxy/ca.pem`. Agent traffic must trust this CA — the launcher commands below mount it for you.

### Multi-replica deployments

If you run more than one Clawvisor replica with the proxy enabled, configure Redis. The held-approval cache otherwise falls back to in-memory and approvals desync across replicas — one replica will hold a request while another has already approved it. The daemon logs a warning at startup when this configuration is detected.

```yaml
redis:
  url: redis://...
```

## Run an agent through the proxy

The simplest flow uses a registered agent:

```bash
# 1. Register an agent. This creates the agent on the daemon and stores its
#    token at ~/.clawvisor/agents.json so launchers can reference it by name.
clawvisor-server agent register my-agent

# 2. Run a command under a runtime session. Mints a session, injects proxy
#    env vars (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, CLAWVISOR_RUNTIME_*, CA trust paths),
#    and execs the command.
clawvisor-server agent run --agent my-agent -- claude
```

The session runs until the wrapped process exits or the configured TTL elapses (default 1 hour). Pass `--ttl-seconds` to override.

If you'd rather inject the env into your current shell — useful for debugging or for launchers that don't tolerate a wrapping process — use `runtime-env`:

```bash
eval "$(clawvisor-server agent runtime-env --agent my-agent)"
claude  # now routes through the proxy
```

## Run a Dockerized agent

Container launchers use a long-lived agent token instead of a runtime session secret so containers can restart without re-minting credentials.

### One-shot `docker run`

```bash
clawvisor-server agent docker-run --agent my-agent -- \
  docker run --rm -it my-agent-image agent serve
```

This injects the env vars and mounts the proxy CA into the container at `/clawvisor/ca.pem`.

### `docker compose`

Generate a Compose override for a named service:

```bash
clawvisor-server agent docker-compose --agent my-agent --service my-svc > clawvisor.override.yml
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f clawvisor.override.yml up
```

The override is templated by default — it references `${CLAWVISOR_AGENT_TOKEN}` rather than baking the token in. Export the token before running compose:

```bash
export CLAWVISOR_AGENT_TOKEN=<token from `clawvisor-server agent register`>
```

### Print env for other launchers

To inspect or pipe the env into a different launcher:

```bash
clawvisor-server agent docker-env --agent my-agent --format env       # KEY=VALUE
clawvisor-server agent docker-env --agent my-agent --format export    # export KEY="VALUE"
clawvisor-server agent docker-env --agent my-agent --format docker-args  # -e KEY=VALUE -e ...
```

## Container isolation (advanced)

The default container flow trusts that the agent honors `HTTPS_PROXY`. For workloads that bypass env-var proxies (e.g. clients that pin DNS and call `connect()` directly), Clawvisor offers a kernel-enforced isolation mode that runs the user container in a netns sidecar with an iptables policy that rejects everything except the proxy and API endpoints.

This requires a separately-running `clawvisor-server proxy expose` instance the container's docker network can reach. `expose` publishes the local proxy and daemon API onto a network-routable bind address with a source-IP allowlist.

```bash
# On the host running the daemon (or a host that can reach it):
clawvisor proxy expose --detach \
  --bind 0.0.0.0 \
  --proxy-port 25291 \
  --api-port 18791
# Stop later with:
clawvisor proxy expose stop
```

By default the allowlist accepts loopback + RFC-1918. Use `--allow-cidr` to narrow or extend it (repeatable).

Then generate the isolated Compose override:

```bash
clawvisor-server agent docker-compose --agent my-agent --service my-svc \
  --isolation=container \
  --expose-url http://10.0.0.5:25291 \
  --expose-api-url http://10.0.0.5:18791 \
  > clawvisor.override.yml
```

The override emits a privileged netns-holder sidecar plus rewires the user service to share its netns via `network_mode: service:…`. Direct `connect()` to anything other than the two expose listeners returns `ECONNREFUSED` at the kernel.

If the user service in the base compose file declares `ports:`, those need to move to the holder. Use `--publish-port` (repeatable, Compose port syntax):

```bash
clawvisor-server agent docker-compose ... \
  --isolation=container \
  --publish-port 18789:18789 \
  --publish-port 0.0.0.0:18790:18790/tcp \
  --expose-url ... --expose-api-url ...
```

The user service automatically clears its inherited `ports:` list with `ports: !reset []`.

The same isolation mode is available for `docker run`:

```bash
clawvisor-server agent docker-run --agent my-agent --isolation=container -- \
  docker run --rm my-agent-image agent serve
```

## Starter profiles

The first time you launch a recognized agent (e.g. `claude`, `codex`), the launcher prompts to apply a starter set of allow rules for that agent's known control-plane traffic — model API calls, telemetry endpoints, OAuth refresh, and so on. This keeps the proxy from holding routine traffic for review while you build out your real policy.

Available profiles ship with Clawvisor:

| Profile ID | Display Name | Triggers on argv | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude_code` | Claude Code | `claude` | `api.anthropic.com`, `platform.claude.com`, `mcp-proxy.anthropic.com`, plugin distribution, telemetry |
| `codex` | Codex | `codex` | `api.openai.com /v1/responses`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `chatgpt.com /backend-api/codex/responses` |

Press `Y` to apply, or `n`/`a` to skip. Both `n` and `a` persist a skip decision keyed by command + profile (not by agent), so future launches of that command won't prompt again for that profile. You can manage these decisions later from the dashboard.

The prompt also won't fire if the agent's runtime settings already record this profile as its starter profile, if the launcher isn't attached to a TTY, or if the launched argv isn't a recognized command key (currently `claude` or `codex`).

To apply a profile non-interactively:

```bash
clawvisor-server agent run --agent my-agent --runtime-profile claude_code -- claude
```

## Observe vs enforce

Each runtime session runs in either observe mode or enforce mode. In observe mode, the proxy logs what it *would* have done — held a request, prompted inline, denied — but lets traffic pass.

New agents default to **enforce**. To make new agents start in observe instead — useful if you'd rather onboard each agent by running it for a while, reviewing the activity feed for unintended egress, promoting rules into your policy, and then flipping to enforce — set the daemon-wide default in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
runtime_policy:
  observation_mode_default: true
```

(Or `CLAWVISOR_RUNTIME_POLICY_OBSERVATION_DEFAULT=true`.) This only affects the initial runtime settings created for new agents; existing agents keep whatever they have.

The launcher prints a notice on every observe-mode run so it's not silently lost.

To override per-launch:

```bash
clawvisor-server agent run --agent my-agent --observe -- claude        # force observe
clawvisor-server agent run --agent my-agent --observe=false -- claude  # force enforce
```

The persistent default for a specific agent is its `runtime_mode` field (`observe` or `enforce`) on the agent's runtime settings record, configurable from the dashboard or via `PUT /api/agents/{id}/runtime-settings`.
