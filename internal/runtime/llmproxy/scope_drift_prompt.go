// renderScopeDriftMenu builds the three-option menu the agent sees when
// a tool call falls outside the active task's scope. The output is
// plain text — the proxy substitutes it as the tool_result content of a
// continuation, so the agent sees a continuation of the same
// conversation rather than an opaque error.
//
// All three options reuse the same control-plane POST shape:
//   (a) expand:     POST /api/control/tasks/<task_id>/expand?surface=inline
//   (b) new_task:   POST /api/control/tasks?surface=inline
//   (c) one_off:    POST /api/control/scope-drifts/<drift_id>/one-off?surface=inline
//
// The agent emits any of these as a normal POST tool call; the
// respective intercept opens an inline approval hold and the user's
// yes/no resolves it. There is no inline assistant-text markup
// machinery — when option (c) was encoded that way, the rendered
// menu's example markup self-matched server-side, consuming the
// one-shot cap before the agent could pick. Routing all three through
// the same intercept shape eliminates that whole class of bug.
//
// There is also an implicit fourth path: the agent picks none of the
// above and just emits its next turn normally. The menu names this in
// prose; the drift TTL-expires unresolved.
//
// The one-shot cap is enforced by the registry (ClaimOption refuses a
// second claim against the same drift_id).
//
// menu fields are the renderer's only inputs. controlBaseURL is the
// synthetic Clawvisor control host (passed in by the caller — see
// RoutingContext.ControlBaseURL). Empty controlBaseURL falls back to a
// path-only render so the agent at least gets the route; the caller
// should always supply a base URL in production.
